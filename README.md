## Fortnite Launcher

This launcher allows you to launch Fortnite via:

- Launching FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe with launch options
- Launching a local NodeJS server for the Fortnite Lobby backend (created by Lawin)
- Injecting a DLL to connect to the in-game server managed by Cuteless
- Choosing a nickname before launching the game
- Choosing the Fortnite installation folder (from season 4 to season 10)
And more.
